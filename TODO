Project:
    TODO:       <kinda Done>The shortest path between two vertices according to the Dijkstra algorithm,
                where both vertices can be provided on the command line using the following
                or similar interface:
                $ > java myJavaProgram inputfile.graphml -s 1 16            
                <!--where the -s switch starts the shortest path calculation of the program with
                1 and 16 being the IDs of the vertices as parameters for the switch.-->    
    TODO:       Connectivity, i.e., whether the the graph is connected
    TODO:       Diameter of the graph, i.e., the maximum distance between any two nodes
                considering the shortest path between them 
    TODO:       At least two Threads should be implemented(Main is already one)
    TODO:       Implement an abstract class and an interface
    TODO:       CLEAN CODE. Make the code clean   
    TODO:       Check for Performance issues



Done:
    TODO:       <Done> The edge names or IDs should be Displayed
    TODO:       <Done> The vertex(nodes) names or IDs should be Displayed
    FIXME:      <Done> Dijkstra doesnt calculate x to 0 correct
    FIXME:      <Done> File saving is not a good experience yet
    TODO:       <Done>It is possible to start the program from the CLI or GUI and provide an input file
                for processing using the following or similar interface:
                $ > java myJavaProgram inputfile.graphml
    TODO:       <Done> Give the User the Option to save the output in a *.txt
    TODO:       <Done> Output the results of the processing into the specified file(s)
                and/or the user interface (command line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI)).
    TODO:       <Done> Output for every Edge
    BUG:        <Done> User should not be able to enter a Number thats bigger than the amount of Nodes
    BUG:        <Done> askStartNode() doesnt work  
    TODO:       <Done> Let the User Input the Path 
    TODO:       <Done> FileCheck needs to be implemented in Main.(If there are any arguments)
