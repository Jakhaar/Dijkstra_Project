    TODO:   Output the results of the processing into the specified file(s)
            and/or the user interface (command line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI)).

    TODO:   It is possible to start the program from the CLI or GUI and provide an input file
            for processing using the following or similar interface:
            $ > java myJavaProgram inputfile.graphml

    TODO:   The vertex(nodes) names or IDs should be Displayed

    TODO:   The edge names or IDs should be Displayed

    TODO:   Diameter of the graph, i.e., the maximum distance between any two nodes

    TODO:   The shortest path between two vertices according to the Dijkstra algorithm,
            where both vertices can be provided on the command line using the following
            or similar interface:
            $ > java myJavaProgram inputfile.graphml -s 1 16
            
            <!--where the -s switch starts the shortest path calculation of the program with
            1 and 16 being the IDs of the vertices as parameters for the switch.-->
